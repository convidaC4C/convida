# ConVIDA Project

After COVID-19 crisis, we face a scenario never seen before, all of humanity has been exposed to general confinement and its differences in impact on people will be determined by individual conditions. Everyone will develop an acute stress picture, most without major affectation and with a quick adaptation. The rest of us will have difficulties to overcome the generated stress and this situation will lead to develop a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Post-traumatic stress disorder is a chronic serious mental illness that needs specialized care in order to overcome it.
