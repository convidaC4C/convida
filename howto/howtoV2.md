# How to implement ConVida:

## Set up Nginx Web Server with Cloudfoundry

Based on [https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/cl-deploy-a-hello-world-webpage-to-bluemix-app/](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/cl-deploy-a-hello-world-webpage-to-bluemix-app/)

The manifest of the Webserver can be viewed [here](https://github.com/convidaC4C/convidaC4C_frontend/blob/master/manifest.yml) and the code of the web page is the repository [convidaC4C_frontend](https://github.com/convidaC4C/convidaC4C_frontend).



## Set up Watson Assistant

Watson Assistant is a conversation AI platform that helps you provide customers fast, straightforward and accurate answers to their questions, across any application, device or channel. 

Follow the instructions of [this manual](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/blob/master/README.md#set-up-an-instance-of-watson-assistant) until step 5 to create the project architecture 

Follow the instruccions of [this manual](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-getting-started) to build a dialog skill

In the dialog skill we create intents. Intents are purposes or goals that are expressed in a customer's input, such as answering a question or processing a bill payment. 
We follow [this manual](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-intents#:~:text=Intents%20are%20purposes%20or%20goals,flow%20for%20responding%20to%20it.)  to create intents.

Also we create entities, which represent information in the user input that is relevant to the user's purpose. We follow [this manual](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-entities) to create entities.


Then we have created a new skill to do a form based on the ASDS test, the json associated is this [skill-COnVIDa-MVP](skill-COnVIDa-MVP-copy.json).


## Set up DB2 Database

### Local db2 docker creation
__Step 1:__ Linux installation
We have used an LTS version as it is a stable version of the Linux based Ubuntu operating system which is mainly aimed at enterprise level server environments.

As well as having a lot of documentation and compatibility.
Follow the instructions of [this manual](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04.4/)


__Step 2:__ Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu
Follow the instructions of [this manual](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)

In Installation methods we have performed the installation using a repository.


__Step 3:__ Download the DB2 DB image
Follow the instructions of [this manual](https://hub.docker.com/_/db2-developer-c-edition)

In section "Getting Db2 Developer-C image" we have used the image db2_developer_c:11.1.4.4-x86_64



__Step 4:__ Install a DB client to connect to your DB2 instance
We downloaded a java engine to make dbeaver work.
We use the java jdk openjdk-11-jre-headless.

Once the DB2 server is installed, we need a client with which to design the databases.
We use dbeaver which we download [here](https://dbeaver.io/download/), download the debian image(Linux Debian package 64 bit (installer))
 
 
### Use of dbeaver to design data tables


### How to exporting table data to CSV format
__Step 1:__ Select a table you want to export. In the context menu choose "Export Data".

__Step 2:__ Choose export format. DBeaver support many different output formats including CSV, HTML, XLSX, etc

__Step 3:__ Set data extraction options. This may affect extraction performance

__Step 4:__ Set export format option. They are specific to the data format you choose on Step 2

__Step 5:__ Set options for output files or clipboard

__Step 6:__ Review what and to what format you will export

__Step 7:__ Press finish. See extraction progress. 


### How to import script to DB2

__Step 1:__ Create the instance DB2.

__Step 2:__ Open the instance and click the option 'Open Console'

__Step 3:__ Open the menu that you find at the top left of screen and click the option 'Run Sql'

__Step 4:__ Finally copy your script and click execute. [Here](https://github.com/convidaC4C/convida/blob/master/howto/ScriptDB) you will find the our script

## DB2 instance creation in ibm cloud.

### Importing tables to the DB2 instance in ibm cloud.
Follow the instructions of [this video](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/Db2whc?topic=Db2whc-load_local) to load the data from our system.
Only well-formatted XML documents can be imported.

We can select that the imported XML data be validated with a schema specified with the IMPORT command, against a schema identified by a schema location flag within the source XML document, or by the schema identified by the schema specifier. 

### Watson connection to DB2 database
We have created a Slackbot to create and search Db2 database entries.
Follow the instructions of [this manual](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-slack-chatbot-database-watson#architecture)


## Use Cloud Functions to insert and read data from Db2

Before insert data to DB2 we had to store the variables in Watson Assistant. We follow [this manual]( https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/watson-conversation-variables ) to 
store the variables in Watson Assistant. In Cloud functions we create the necessary querys to implement COnVIDa, which are: findUser, insrtUser, insertTest. We follow [this manual]( https://www.db2tutorial.com/db2-basics/db2-insert/ ) to create the querys.

We connect watson Assistant with Cloud function by a Webhook. A webhook is a mechanism that allows you to call an external program based on something that is happening in your program. We follow [this manual](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-dialog-webhooks) to know how webhooks works.
