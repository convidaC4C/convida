# How to implement ConVida:

## Set up Nginx Web Server with Cloudfoundry

Based on [https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/cl-deploy-a-hello-world-webpage-to-bluemix-app/](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/cl-deploy-a-hello-world-webpage-to-bluemix-app/)

The manifest of the Webserver can be viewed [here](https://github.com/convidaC4C/convidaC4C_frontend/blob/master/manifest.yml) and the code of the web page is the repository [convidaC4C_ftontend](https://github.com/convidaC4C/convidaC4C_frontend).



## Set up Watson Assistant

Follow the instructions of [this manual](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/Solution-Starter-Kit-Communication-2020/blob/master/README.md#set-up-an-instance-of-watson-assistant) until step 5.

Then we have created a new skill to do a form based on the ASDS test
